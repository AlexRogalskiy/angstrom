Parser combinators built for speed and memory efficiency

Angstrom is a parser-combinator library that provides a monadic and applicative
interface for constructing parsers with unbounded lookahead. Its parsers can
consume input incrementally, whether in a blocking or non-blocking environment.
To achieve efficient incremental parsing, Angstrom offers both a buffered and
unbuffered interface to input streams, with the unbuffered interface enabling
zero-copy IO. With these features and low-level iteration parser primitives,
Angstrom makes it easy to write efficient, expressive, and reusable parsers
suitable for high-performance applications.
